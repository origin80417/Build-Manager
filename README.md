## Build Manager
* This module modifies the build.prop for network and overall performance boost. It also replaces the apns-comf.xml, modified to make Visible Wireless' apn show up for user along with replacing CarrierConfig apk inside the system and vendor to further help Visible Wireless work for any phone they say cannot. Tested on Xiaomi Mi Mix, Mi Mix 3, Mi Mix 3 5g, and Mi Note 10 on both MIUI and AOSP based roms.

## Version
Initial release v1.0
 
Thank you to the original BuildManager dev for his work.
